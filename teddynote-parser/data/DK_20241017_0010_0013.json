the front-month futures contract amid lower US\nstockpiles,” said Axel Rudolph, IG’s senior technical\nanalyst.\nUS crude inventories fell by 1.6 million barrels for\nthe week ended Oct. 11, latest data from the American\nPetroleum Institution showed.\nThe reported decline comes in contrast to analysts’\nexpectations of a 1.7 million barrel build over the same\nperiod, according to analysts surveyed by S&P Global\nCommodity Insights.\nNationwide gasoline stocks were also reported\nlower, falling by 5.9 million barrels over the week, while\ndistillate inventories declined by 2.7 million barrels, the\nAPI data showed.\n“API numbers released overnight were somewhat\nconstructive for the oil market,” ING commodity\nstrategists said Oct. 17.\nInvestors await official data from the US Energy\nInformation Administration, due later in the global day.\nPrices were also supported by lingering concerns\nover supply from the Middle East while technical\nindicators keep price moves broadly rangebound.\n“It is the fourth day in a row that the front-month\nBrent crude oil futures contract oscillates around its\nbreached July-to-October downtrend line at $74.08/b,”\nIG’s Rudolph observed.\nMultiple leaks in Iranian crude oil pipelines leading\nto Iran’s Kharg Island – the country’s main export\nterminal — injected fresh uncertainty over the region’s\nexport reliability.\nThe cause of leaks remain unknown, compounding\nongoing geopolitical tensions that are fueling supply\ndisruption concerns in the region.\nHowever, “the prospect of increased OPEC+ supply\noffsets a potential threat to Middle East supplies,”\nSaxo’s strategy team said in a note Oct. 17.\nInvestors continue to weigh the threat of escalating\ntensions in the Middle East against a supply surplus\nforecast by OPEC and the International Energy Agency.\n“Market outlooks released by OPEC and IEA this\nweek suggested sluggish demand and a sizable supply\nsurplus for the next year, which is keeping pressure on\noil prices,” added ING strategists.\nSubscriber Notes\nPlatts proposes to discontinue four CNY-related FX\nassessments\nPlatts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights,\nproposes to
